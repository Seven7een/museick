# Museick

**A Music Memory Journal**

---

## 🧠 Overview
Museick is a calendar-based music journal that helps users reflect on their listening habits by choosing their favorite (**Muse**) and least favorite (**Ick**) song each month. At the end of the year, Museick compiles these choices into a personalized musical wrap-up.
